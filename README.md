# Steganography
>> Steganography is the practice of hiding secret information within another message or object.
>> Steganography can be used to hide text, images, videos, or audio.
>> The hidden data is extracted at its destination.
>> Steganography can be combined with encryption for extra protection.

1) used the Python for programming.(Stego.py) file is attached above.
2) installed the openCV libraries for the project
3) using python idle created a steganography program.
4) it gets a secret message and hides within a cover image and creates one similar encrypted image with a key password.
5) after encryption we need to give a key or password which is set while encrypting
6) using this passcode we decrypt a image and then we can read secret message.
